# eCook

[My Notes](notes.md)

This is an application that not only stores the user's recipes, but also will recommend new recipes, can add new recipes, and also has a function where you can input ingredients and the application will recommend a recipe based upon the ingredients listed.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

If you were to open your fridge right now, you would see a concophony of lost ingredients. You make a recipe, and when the recipe asks for half of an onion, the other half sits sadly in your fridge. We present the solution. Not only a hub to store your home recipes, but a way to discover new recipes, and most important of all, a place to ask what you can do with all of your leftover scrap that will turn into another delicious meal. eCook is your one stop shop for everything cooking, because the only thing better than cooking is eating!
